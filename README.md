# textual_travel_guide
A web app to give a text-based overview of an unknown place - important building types, their abundance and summarization of the reviews received by visitors. Thus, one can get an idea of how well-facilitated/connected an unknown place. 


### Brief background :-
This project was my B.Tech final year major project.

"There is an increasing need to gain awareness of a specific location to generate opportunities for individuals . They may be medical , educational , etc.​

There are a number of web services that provide us a geographical representation of a place. ​

But a need for a comprehensive and coherent summary of a place has been deemed necessary also underlined by the increase in location specific services. ​

This leads us to the text summarization of a Location.​"

The project was partly executed on university computer and was disorganised (scattered in parts), hence it has been completely reorganised now.
""Also it has some secret API keys(for googlemaps and openai), hence not uploading here.""


### Prerequisites :-
Please see "requirements.txt".


### Brief info about the files :-
  1. "app.py" is the main app for Streamlit.

  2. "summarize.py" is the python file where the main logic is located. "app.py" uses the results from "summarize.py".

​
### Building Categories ​:-
To determine whether a particular location is well facilitated or not, we decided to look for buildings of certain categories.​
They are as follows :-​
1. Banks or ATMs,
2. Hospitals or medical shops,
3. Hotels​,
4. Restaurants or cafes ​,
5. Shopping places,
6. Stores​,
7. Parks or zoo​,
8. Bars or liquor stores.​
