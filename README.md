# textual_travel_guide
A web app to give a text-based overview of an unknown place - important building types, their abundance and summarization of the reviews received by visitors. Thus, one can get an idea of how well-facilitated/connected an unknown place is. 


### Brief background: -
The project was partly executed on university computer (as it is part of my B.Tech thesis-research project) and was disorganized (scattered in parts), hence it has been completely reorganized now and uploaded on GitHub to give a practical aspect of my research.
""Also it has some secret API keys(for Googlemaps and OpenAI), hence not uploading here.""


"There is an increasing need to gain awareness of a specific location to generate opportunities for individuals. They may be medical, educational, etc.

There are a number of web services that provide us a geographical representation of a place. 

But a need for a comprehensive and coherent summary of a place has been deemed necessary also underlined by the increase in location specific services. 

This leads us to the text summarization of a Location."



### Prerequisites: -
Please see "requirements.txt".


### Brief info about the files: -
  1. "app.py" is the main app for Streamlit.

  2. "summarize.py" is the python file where the main logic is located. "app.py" uses the results from "summarize.py".


### Brief workflow: -

### Building Categories: -
To determine whether a particular location is well facilitated or not, we decided to look for buildings of certain categories.
They are as follows: -
1. Banks or ATMs,
2. Hospitals or medical shops,
3. Hotels,
4. Restaurants or cafes ,
5. Shopping places,
6. Stores,
7. Parks or zoo,
8. Bars or liquor stores.
